# Voice_AI_Bot

 
This project is an OpenAI-powered conversational chatbot with text and voice interaction capabilities, built using Streamlit. It leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o for text-based responses and Whisper for speech-to-text conversion. The chatbot supports text-to-speech synthesis, enabling audio playback of responses for a more interactive experience. Users can communicate via text or voice, with real-time transcription and automated response generation.
